# Hospital_Stay_Duration_Prediction

## Project Overview

This project predicts the length of hospital stay for patients based on demographic and medical data. The goal is to help healthcare providers optimize resource allocation, improve patient care planning, and forecast patient flow more effectively using machine learning techniques.

## Objectives

-Analyze hospital data to uncover key factors affecting patient stay duration.

-Build and compare multiple classification models.

-Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning.

## Techniques Used

-Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and treated outliers.

-Modeling: Implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting classifiers.

-Hyperparameter Optimization: Used GridSearchCV for tuning key model parameters.

-Evaluation: Compared models based on accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix results.

## Tools & Libraries

-Python

-Pandas, NumPy

-Scikit-learn

-Matplotlib, Seaborn

-Jupyter Notebook

## Results

-Gradient Boosting achieved an 83% test accuracy, outperforming other models.

-Model tuning improved efficiency and accuracy by approximately 12%.

-Identified key patient features influencing hospital stay durations, aiding data-driven hospital management.

## Visualizations

include plots such as:

-Feature correlation heatmap

-Distribution of stay duration classes

-Classification report or confusion matrix visualization

## Dataset Note

The dataset used in this project was provided as part of a DataMites course module and is not included in this repository due to access restrictions.

## Key Insights

-Patient age, medical condition, and admission type strongly influence hospital stay duration.

-Ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting provide robust performance in healthcare prediction tasks.

-Predictive modeling can support operational decisions in hospital management systems.
